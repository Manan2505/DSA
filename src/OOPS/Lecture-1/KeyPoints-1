1.	classes are named group of properties and functions. Real life examples : car, human
2.	A class is template for an object and object is an instance(physical stuff) of class.
3.	objects are stored in the heap memory and reference variables are stored in stack.
4.	dot operator links the reference variables with the instance variables.
5.	new keyword do dynamic memory allocation
6.	by default values of int is 0, float =0.0 and string =null
7.	constructor is a special type of function that runs when an object is created.
8.	This keyword 
9.	Primitives are not objects so they are not stored in heap memory. They are stored in stack memory
10. In java there is no pass by reference only pass by value.
11. Always initialize the final variables.
12. Final gurantee the immutability only for primitives datatypes, for non-primitives we can change the value of objects.(see code)
public static void main(String[] args) {
   final Demo name=new Demo();
  name.value=8;
    System.out.println(name.value);
  }
}
class Demo{
  int value=3;
}


13. Finalizer is used to determine what actions to perform when object is destroyed. Finalizer can be added to the class using finalize method.
Any object of particular class is destroyed, the finalize method gets called.(you canâ€™t use finalize method manually, it is called automatically)
